Finally, the weekend arrived. 
<br>I’m going to the art school tomorrow.
<br>I’ll draw for 3 hours. 
<br>And then I’ll meet my friend, we plan to eat webfoot octopus.

            I’m proud of myself, because I was still going to work today.
<br>I am not sure whether to go to the office every morning.
<br>I love my job, but I’m so tired. I have to rest. 
<br>I am sure that if I continue like this, I will die soon.
