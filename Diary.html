    Tomorrow I'm not going to work. I'm going to the hospital for a medical checkup. 
 <br>I like going to the hospital because I can prevent diseases and get treatment. 
 <br>There is always a long waiting time at the hospital, so I usually read a book or study something while I'm waiting. 
 <br>Maybe tomorrow I'll study for the Project Manager Examination.

            <h3><strong>2023/07/02 Sunday</h3></strong>
I decided to take the Project Manager Examination in October. 
<br>This test is only offered once a year. I'm not ready yet, but I don't want to wait any longer. 
<br>So I ordered a textbook online this morning. The pass rate for the test is just 13%. 
<br>I'm not confident that I will pass the exam, but I believe it will be a good opportunity for me to improve my skills. 
<br>I'm going to enjoy the challenge.

            <h3><strong>2023/07/01 Saturday</h3></strong>
            The 2023 Seoul Queer Culture Festival is held today. 
<br>But I'm in Japan, so I can't join it in person. 
<br>I joined the 2023 Online Queer Culture Festival instead. 
<br>Every year, I make an avatar that walks with other queers on the online site. 
<p><img src="online_queer0.jpeg"width=20%></p>
<br>This year's avatar is a Korean shaman, and I enjoyed creating it. 
<p><img src="mudang.jpeg"width=25%></p>
<br>And I went to the art lesson and drew from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with an hour for lunch. 
<br>I want to draw every day. The next lesson is in two weeks.

<br>I will modify the drawing of a bottle, and draw bottle's label on the week after next.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/30 Friday</h3></strong>
            I didn't absent to work this week. So I'm proud of myself.  
<br>This is natural as a member of society but I have too much work in my position. 
<br>I want to change my work. I'm interested in a manager position. 
<br>I think  a role of manager is harder than now. However it must be rewarding and fun. 
<br>But I need to rest first now. Tomorrow I'm going to go to the art lesson. 
<br>I'm looking forward to the lesson.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/29 Thursday</h3></strong>
            I like learning through discussion. I also like to find reasons for my thoughts.  
<br>I don't discuss to win. If someone makes me understand, I accept it gladly. 
<br>But I feel angry at those who insist without evidence.  
<br>To understand the other person's thoughts, I ask many questions.
<br>So sometimes I worry that I hurt my conversation partners.

            For the remainder of the year, I will try to get more high score on the TOEIC test. 
<br>I plan to take the test in October. So every day I study English. 
<br>But I'm not confident in my ability to memorize words.  
<br>I want to know how can I memorize words.

            It was a scorcher today, so I almost melted on my way to the office.
<br>It's still June, but it's so hot, I'm worried about the temperature of July and August.
<br>After work I went to the hair salon, and cut my hair very short. 
<br>I had a meeting in English with the foreign vendors. 
<br>I couldn't speak a word. I have to study English harder.

            Today, my favorite co-worker returned to work. 
<br>I'm very happy to meet her. I wish her good health.
<br>After work I went to the hair salon, and cut my hair very short. 
<br>Until yesterday I wanted to change my hair to black. 
<br>But after cutting my hair, I changed my mind.
<br>I decided to dye my hair pink. I like this hair style.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/25 Sunday</h3></strong>
            I learned to tell time in English at my English lesson.
<br>And I also learned about hands of clock, which are called the hour hand, the minute hand, and the second hand. 
<br>After the lesson, I cleaned my room. 
<br>I threw away four small bookshelves. 
<br>So my room became clean, I feel good.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/24 Saturday</h3></strong>
            After a long time I went to a theater today. What I watched the movie is The Super Mario bros. 
<br>So I would like to have a lot of time and money.
<br>Honestly, I don't like Super Mario series. Because, I think Mario is unattractive and princess peach is a too passive. 
<br>But this movie is different. Mario is still unattractive, but princess peach is much more active and independent. 
<br>It seems that the characters change with the times.

            I have a lot of passion. I want to know and learn a lot. 
<br>So I would like to have a lot of time and money.
<br>For that reason, when I was young, my dream was to become a vampire. 
<br>I thought I needed a long life to achieve my goals.
<br>Even now, I think that may be possible. 
<br>Nowadays, medicine has progressed a lot, so I think I can live a long life even if I don't drink blood.

            Today I didn’t go to work either.
<br>I think this was a good choice.
<br>But I should go to the office tomorrow.
<br>I'm going to go to bed early today.

                My condition is worse than I thought. 
    <br>So I slept all day. But my condition didn’t get better.
    <br>I am not sure whether to go to the office tomorrow.
    <br>A YouTuber said that Italian espresso tastes very good, so I would like to drink it.

            I love working, but I felt too tired, so I wanted to rest today.
<br>However I went to the company, because I felt a sense of responsibility.
<br>So, now I exhaust.
<br>Tomorrow, I won't go work.
<br>It's hard to me, but I'll try to rest all day.

I cleaned bedsheets all day.
<br>It’s very hot and sunny day, so washing dries very quickly.
<br>I like to clean my bedsheets. I love the smell of dried laundry.
<br>If I’ll get holiday, I would like to clean the whole house.
<br>I'm bad at rest and laziness.

            I’m interested in Korean food. 
<br>I love vegetables.

            Lately I'm interested in minimalism. 
<br>Because, someone said if your house is mess, you will get poor. 
<br>And another person said your room's condition is like same as your mind.
<br>I agree with their opinions. I want be a rich person. 
<br>I'm going to throw unnecessary things.
