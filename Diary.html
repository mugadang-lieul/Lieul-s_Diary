<h3><strong>2023/07/28 Friday</strong></h3>
It's hard to find someone who is a good match for me at work. 
<br>Last year, I wanted to learn a new tool for checking ads. 
<br>I had used a different tool as a reviewer, so I wasn't familiar with the new one. 
<br>I attended the new hire tool training, and I found a coworker who was a great teacher. 
<br>She was motivated and a quick learner. I really liked her, and I wanted to teach her everything I knew. 
<br>But she quit her job and is going back to Korea tomorrow because she's not well. 
<br>Today was our last day together in Japan. We ate Korean food and talked a lot. 
<br>I can't believe I only worked with her for 8 months. 
<br>I enjoyed working with her and learned a lot. I hope to see her again soon.
<p>She gave me Flowers, a letter, and a book<a image src="flowers.jpeg" width="40%"></a></p>

<h3><strong>2023/07/27 Thursday</strong></h3>
Some of my co-workers are going to quit the company. 
<br>This has me feeling disturbed. 
<br>I also want to change jobs, but I haven't found a good company yet.
<br>I've learned a lot of things at this company. 
<br>But there isn't anything new for me to learn anymore. 
<br>That's why I'm not enjoying my job. 
<br>I want to grow every day, and I hate a life without growth.

<h3><strong>2023/07/26 Wednesday</strong></h3>
I'm changing the design of my homepage. 
<br>I've added a background image, and I'm going to add a comment function and a YouTube page that teaches Korean for foreigners. 
<br>Even if I fail, I enjoy finding problems and trying to solve them.

I try to avoid eating red meat as much as possible. 
<br>Instead, I usually eat chicken and seafood. I especially love to eat sea vegetables. 
<br>But maybe I can't eat them anymore. 
<br>Japan plans to discharge contaminated water from nuclear power plants into the sea. The sea is not just for Japan.
<br>Some people say that contaminated water from nuclear power plants is safe. 
<br>Do they really believe that? I think nobody knows the result.

<h3><strong>2023/07/23 Sunday</strong></h3>
I feel anxious about my future, the climate crisis, and the world's economic woes.
<br>These seem like different problems, but they are closely connected. 
<br>In my opinion, people need to solve environmental problems first. 
<br>We need to produce less and consume less. 
<br>I've heard that there is too much clothing waste. 
<br>Clothing companies produce far more clothes than we need. 
<br>And they produce a lot of synthetic fibers that cannot be recycled during the manufacturing process. 
<br>Perhaps if capitalism continues, these problems will not change.

<h3><strong>2023/07/19 Wednesday</h3></strong>
Korea is having a hard time right now. It rained too much, and many people died. In my opinion, it's very important who is a leader. 
<br>In the government of Yoon Suk Yeol, leaders aren't working, and even when problems happen, they don't take responsibility. 
<br>It seems like Korea is in an anarchical condition. 
<br>I'm worried about Korea.

<h3><strong>2023/07/18 Tuesday</h3></strong>
I got to know the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) when I was a high school student. 
<br>At that time, the test said I was an ENFP. But I thought it was a little different.
<br>When I got to know myself better, I took the test again. The result was ENTP. 
<br>I believe this type explains me well. The MBTI test is helpful in my work environment. 
<br>I like the Enneagram test more. But since the Enneagram is more complex than the MBTI, people like the MBTI more.

<br>So I plan to go to the art class, after the examination. 
<br>I also have to finish the translation. 
<br>From today to Monday are holidays. During these holidays I'll do my best.
<br>I set up a standard about English. The goal is to discuss in English.

<br>I'm a Christian, so I already knew it. But I didn't know that they don't use number 13 for a floor of apartments.   
<br>In Chinese character cultures, number 4 is considered unlucky. 
<br>Number 4's pronunciation is same as 'death'. 
<br>So, Koreans don't use number 4, use F instead for a floor of apartments. 
<br>Cultural differences are fun.

I have to finish translating the book as soon as possible. 
<br>Today, I translated the book all day.   
<br>So, I can't focus on other studies, such as English, coding, and project managing. 
<br>Particularly, I don't have enough time to prepare for the Project Manager Examination, which makes me worried.
<br>And I couldn't write my resume. I have too many things to do. 
<br>When I have a lot of work to do like this, I think of the story of the boy and the starfishes. 
<br>Just like the boy saved a starfish one at a time, I think I should do my tasks one at a time.

I'm going to update my resume and job record.
<br>I'm interested in project management.  
<br>I don't like to do the same work. I want to increase the number of things I can do. 
<br>During this weekend, I plan to translate the book and study for the project manager test.

I had to get my son's passport, I went to the Korean Consulate General in Japan. 
<br>It required many documents. 
<br>There were some of the necessary documents, so I wanted to get them at a convenience store. 
<br>But the area I live in didn't offer that service. 
<br>So I had to go to the Resident Administrative Service Center on the subway for 30 minutes. 
<br>Japan is too slow to digitize. 
<br>In fact, it's more inconvenient than before. I don't know why.

I finished my work early, and I went to the hospital. 
<br>Once every three months, I go to the hospital to check my illness. 
<br>Every time I wait a very long time. Today also I waited so long, it was so bored that I almost died. 
<br>It's a good idea that I brought my laptop and iPad in the hospital. 
<br>I used the laptop to translate a book, and I watched YouTube on the iPad. 
<br>The treatment ended too late, so I couldn't pay for it. 
<br>Next time, I want to finish the treatment to pay for it.

        Today I had a medical checkup. 
<br>I couldn't drink water after 9 pm. last night. 
<br>There was a urine test, which was difficult for me to urinate. 
<br>The checkup was over at 10:15 am., and I had enough time to translate a book. 
<br>However, I fell asleep.

    Tomorrow I'm not going to work. I'm going to the hospital for a medical checkup. 
 <br>I like going to the hospital because I can prevent diseases and get treatment. 
 <br>There is always a long waiting time at the hospital, so I usually read a book or study something while I'm waiting. 
 <br>Maybe tomorrow I'll study for the Project Manager Examination.

I decided to take the Project Manager Examination in October. 
<br>This test is only offered once a year. I'm not ready yet, but I don't want to wait any longer. 
<br>So I ordered a textbook online this morning. The pass rate for the test is just 13%. 
<br>I'm not confident that I will pass the exam, but I believe it will be a good opportunity for me to improve my skills. 
<br>I'm going to enjoy the challenge.

            The 2023 Seoul Queer Culture Festival is held today. 
<br>But I'm in Japan, so I can't join it in person. 
<br>I joined the 2023 Online Queer Culture Festival instead. 
<br>Every year, I make an avatar that walks with other queers on the online site. 
<p><img src="online_queer0.jpeg"width=20%></p>
<br>This year's avatar is a Korean shaman, and I enjoyed creating it. 
<p><img src="mudang.jpeg"width=25%></p>
<br>And I went to the art lesson and drew from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with an hour for lunch. 
<br>I want to draw every day. The next lesson is in two weeks.

            I didn't absent to work this week. So I'm proud of myself.  
<br>This is natural as a member of society but I have too much work in my position. 
<br>I want to change my work. I'm interested in a manager position. 
<br>I think  a role of manager is harder than now. However it must be rewarding and fun. 
<br>But I need to rest first now. Tomorrow I'm going to go to the art lesson. 
<br>I'm looking forward to the lesson.

            I like learning through discussion. I also like to find reasons for my thoughts.  
<br>I don't discuss to win. If someone makes me understand, I accept it gladly. 
<br>But I feel angry at those who insist without evidence.  
<br>To understand the other person's thoughts, I ask many questions.
<br>So sometimes I worry that I hurt my conversation partners.

            It was a scorcher today, so I almost melted on my way to the office.
<br>It's still June, but it's so hot, I'm worried about the temperature of July and August.
<br>After work I went to the hair salon, and cut my hair very short. 
<br>I had a meeting in English with the foreign vendors. 
<br>I couldn't speak a word. I have to study English harder.

<br>I'm very happy to meet her. I wish her good health.
<br>After work I went to the hair salon, and cut my hair very short. 
<br>Until yesterday I wanted to change my hair to black. 
<br>But after cutting my hair, I changed my mind.
<br>I decided to dye my hair pink. I like this hair style.

<br>And I also learned about hands of clock, which are called the hour hand, the minute hand, and the second hand. 
<br>After the lesson, I cleaned my room. 
<br>I threw away four small bookshelves. 
<br>So my room became clean, I feel good.

            After a long time I went to a theater today. What I watched the movie is The Super Mario bros. 
<br>So I would like to have a lot of time and money.
<br>Honestly, I don't like Super Mario series. Because, I think Mario is unattractive and princess peach is a too passive. 
<br>But this movie is different. Mario is still unattractive, but princess peach is much more active and independent. 
<br>It seems that the characters change with the times.

            I have a lot of passion. I want to know and learn a lot. 
<br>So I would like to have a lot of time and money.
<br>For that reason, when I was young, my dream was to become a vampire. 
<br>I thought I needed a long life to achieve my goals.
<br>Even now, I think that may be possible. 
<br>Nowadays, medicine has progressed a lot, so I think I can live a long life even if I don't drink blood.
