            <h3><strong>2023/07/09 Sunday</h3></strong>
I heard that number 13 is considered unlucky in Europe from my English teacher. 
<br>I'm a Christian, so I already knew it. But I didn't know that they don't use number 13 for a floor of apartments.
<br>In Chinese character cultures, number 4 is considered unlucky. 
<br>Number 4's pronunciation is same as 'death'. 
<br>So, Koreans don't use number 4, use F instead for a floor of apartments. 
<br>Cultural differences are fun.

            <h3><strong>2023/07/08 Saturday</h3></strong>
I have to finish translating the book as soon as possible. 
<br>Today, I translated the book all day.   
<br>So, I can't focus on other studies, such as English, coding, and project managing. 
<br>Particularly, I don't have enough time to prepare for the Project Manager Examination, which makes me worried.
<br>And I couldn't write my resume. I have too many things to do. 
<br>When I have a lot of work to do like this, I think of the story of the boy and the starfishes. 
<br>Just like the boy saved a starfish one at a time, I think I should do my tasks one at a time.

I'm going to update my resume and job record.
<br>I'm interested in project management.  
<br>I don't like to do the same work. I want to increase the number of things I can do. 
<br>During this weekend, I plan to translate the book and study for the project manager test.

            <h3><strong>2023/07/06 Thursday</h3></strong>
I had to get my son's passport, I went to the Korean Consulate General in Japan. 
<br>It required many documents. 
<br>There were some of the necessary documents, so I wanted to get them at a convenience store. 
<br>But the area I live in didn't offer that service. 
<br>So I had to go to the Resident Administrative Service Center on the subway for 30 minutes. 
<br>Japan is too slow to digitize. 
<br>In fact, it's more inconvenient than before. I don't know why.

            <h3><strong>2023/07/05 Wednesday</h3></strong>
I finished my work early, and I went to the hospital. 
<br>Once every three months, I go to the hospital to check my illness. 
<br>Every time I wait a very long time. Today also I waited so long, it was so bored that I almost died. 
<br>It's a good idea that I brought my laptop and iPad in the hospital. 
<br>I used the laptop to translate a book, and I watched YouTube on the iPad. 
<br>The treatment ended too late, so I couldn't pay for it. 
<br>Next time, I want to finish the treatment to pay for it.

        Today I had a medical checkup. 
<br>I couldn't drink water after 9 pm. last night. 
<br>There was a urine test, which was difficult for me to urinate. 
<br>The checkup was over at 10:15 am., and I had enough time to translate a book. 
<br>However, I fell asleep.

            <h3><strong>2023/07/03 Monday</h3></strong>
    Tomorrow I'm not going to work. I'm going to the hospital for a medical checkup. 
 <br>I like going to the hospital because I can prevent diseases and get treatment. 
 <br>There is always a long waiting time at the hospital, so I usually read a book or study something while I'm waiting. 
 <br>Maybe tomorrow I'll study for the Project Manager Examination.

            <h3><strong>2023/07/02 Sunday</h3></strong>
I decided to take the Project Manager Examination in October. 
<br>This test is only offered once a year. I'm not ready yet, but I don't want to wait any longer. 
<br>So I ordered a textbook online this morning. The pass rate for the test is just 13%. 
<br>I'm not confident that I will pass the exam, but I believe it will be a good opportunity for me to improve my skills. 
<br>I'm going to enjoy the challenge.

            <h3><strong>2023/07/01 Saturday</h3></strong>
            The 2023 Seoul Queer Culture Festival is held today. 
<br>But I'm in Japan, so I can't join it in person. 
<br>I joined the 2023 Online Queer Culture Festival instead. 
<br>Every year, I make an avatar that walks with other queers on the online site. 
<p><img src="online_queer0.jpeg"width=20%></p>
<br>This year's avatar is a Korean shaman, and I enjoyed creating it. 
<p><img src="mudang.jpeg"width=25%></p>
<br>And I went to the art lesson and drew from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with an hour for lunch. 
<br>I want to draw every day. The next lesson is in two weeks. 
<p>a.m.<br><img src="bottle0710_1.jpeg"width=40%></p>

            <h3><strong>2023/06/30 Friday</h3></strong>
            I didn't absent to work this week. So I'm proud of myself.  
<br>This is natural as a member of society but I have too much work in my position. 
<br>I want to change my work. I'm interested in a manager position. 
<br>I think  a role of manager is harder than now. However it must be rewarding and fun. 
<br>But I need to rest first now. Tomorrow I'm going to go to the art lesson. 
<br>I'm looking forward to the lesson.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/29 Thursday</h3></strong>
            I like learning through discussion. I also like to find reasons for my thoughts.  
<br>I don't discuss to win. If someone makes me understand, I accept it gladly. 
<br>But I feel angry at those who insist without evidence.  
<br>To understand the other person's thoughts, I ask many questions.
<br>So sometimes I worry that I hurt my conversation partners.

            For the remainder of the year, I will try to get more high score on the TOEIC test. 
<br>I plan to take the test in October. So every day I study English. 
<br>But I'm not confident in my ability to memorize words.  
<br>I want to know how can I memorize words.

            It was a scorcher today, so I almost melted on my way to the office.
<br>It's still June, but it's so hot, I'm worried about the temperature of July and August.
<br>After work I went to the hair salon, and cut my hair very short. 
<br>I had a meeting in English with the foreign vendors. 
<br>I couldn't speak a word. I have to study English harder.

            Today, my favorite co-worker returned to work. 
<br>I'm very happy to meet her. I wish her good health.
<br>After work I went to the hair salon, and cut my hair very short. 
<br>Until yesterday I wanted to change my hair to black. 
<br>But after cutting my hair, I changed my mind.
<br>I decided to dye my hair pink. I like this hair style.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/25 Sunday</h3></strong>
            I learned to tell time in English at my English lesson.
<br>And I also learned about hands of clock, which are called the hour hand, the minute hand, and the second hand. 
<br>After the lesson, I cleaned my room. 
<br>I threw away four small bookshelves. 
<br>So my room became clean, I feel good.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/24 Saturday</h3></strong>
            After a long time I went to a theater today. What I watched the movie is The Super Mario bros. 
<br>So I would like to have a lot of time and money.
<br>Honestly, I don't like Super Mario series. Because, I think Mario is unattractive and princess peach is a too passive. 
<br>But this movie is different. Mario is still unattractive, but princess peach is much more active and independent. 
<br>It seems that the characters change with the times.

            I have a lot of passion. I want to know and learn a lot. 
<br>So I would like to have a lot of time and money.
<br>For that reason, when I was young, my dream was to become a vampire. 
<br>I thought I needed a long life to achieve my goals.
<br>Even now, I think that may be possible. 
<br>Nowadays, medicine has progressed a lot, so I think I can live a long life even if I don't drink blood.

    <br>So I slept all day. But my condition didn’t get better.
    <br>I am not sure whether to go to the office tomorrow.
    <br>A YouTuber said that Italian espresso tastes very good, so I would like to drink it.

<br>However I went to the company, because I felt a sense of responsibility.

I cleaned bedsheets all day.
<br>It’s very hot and sunny day, so washing dries very quickly.
<br>I like to clean my bedsheets. I love the smell of dried laundry.

<br>I'm bad at rest and laziness.
