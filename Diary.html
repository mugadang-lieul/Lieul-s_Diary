            <h3><strong>2023/06/15 Thursday</h3></strong>
            I’m proud of myself, because I was still going to work today.
<br>I am not sure whether to go to the office every morning.
<br>I love my job, but I’m so tired. I have to rest. 
<br>I am sure that if I continue like this, I will die soon.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/14 Wednesday</h3></strong>
            It’s very hot and humid today. I hate that I sweat heavily. 
<br>I had a hard time with a lot of work today. 
<br>I’d like to have some rest.
<br>I can’t wait for this weekend.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/13 Tuesday</h3></strong>
            I was too tired yesterday. So I forgot to write the diary. 
<br>Lately I study to make a website. 
<br>I decided to write my English diary on that website.
<br>I’d like to make it as soon as fast.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/11 Sunday</h3></strong>
            I’m interested in Korean food. 
<br>I love vegetables.
<br>As far as possible, I don’t eat red meat. 
<br>Because I’m worried about the climate crisis.

            <h3><strong>2023/06/10 Saterday</h3></strong>
            Lately I'm interested in minimalism. 
<br>Because, someone said if your house is mess, you will get poor. 
<br>And another person said your room's condition is like same as your mind.
<br>I agree with their opinions. I want be a rich person. 
<br>I'm going to throw unnecessary things.
